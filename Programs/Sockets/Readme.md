# Understanding SOCKETS 
To begin with let us start by writing a small program that will send a request 
and in-turn wait recieve a response from and Endpoint processing requests.

# ServiceProvider
Basic Work:
The work of the service provider is to process request and provide response to the
Requester.

Note : We will extend this functionality based on on requirement further


# ServiceReciever 
Entity or Endpoint which will send a request and wait on response

Note : Again we can extend the functionality on case basis
